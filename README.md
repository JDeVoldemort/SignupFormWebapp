# Overview

With this project I am getting some practice with C# using razorpages to build a basic form input/ handling site. 

I wrote software to take form input and display it. Using SQL to store the data and razorpages to display it.

The purpose was to get some practice with C# and razorpages, and build the foundation for a more complex site.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

I used C# and the razorpages library to build the site. I used SQL to store the data.
